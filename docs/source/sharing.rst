Sharing Profiles
================

The OSG Usage App provides a service to share profiles (collections of graphs) with other uses easily.


Sharing your Profile
--------------------

The OSG Usage App has the ability to generate a link that can be used by others to load the profile.  A simple web service stores the profiles when you click on the sharing link, and can be retrieved by others when creating a new profile.

After you have created a profile that you would like to share, click on the *Share* button in the top navigation bar.  It will open a dialog to fill in attributes that you would like to assign to the profile, such as *Name* and *Description*.  

.. image:: images/shareDialog.png
   :width: 606
   :height: 466
   :scale: 70 %
   :align: center

Once you have entered these values, click on the share button.  It will generate a URL that you can copy into an email, or IM, and can be used by another user to load the profile.

Profiles save everything, including:

* All graphs that are in the profile.
* The refine parameters for the profile and each graph.
* Any graphs that where :ref:`added <addinggraphs>` by you.


.. note::
   The remote user will not receive updates if you change a previously shared profile.
