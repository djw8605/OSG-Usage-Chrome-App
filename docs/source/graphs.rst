Graphs are the heart of the OSG Usage App.  You can add them, remove them, and refine the graph's displayed data.

Adding new Graphs
-----------------

Adding a new graph is done in the graph dropdown box in the navigation bar.

   Graph dropdown box showing the *Add Graph* option.
   
After opening the dialog, enter the graph name and description.  Both of these attributes are arbitrary and will be used only for display purposes.

   :align: center
   :width: 606
   :height: 521
   :scale: 70 %
   
   Add graph dialog showing values filled in.

The **Base Graph URL** refers to the URL of the graph from `gratiaweb <http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/>`_.  A list of availble graphs are availble in the gratiaweb `backpage <http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/xml/>`_.  Select any of these graphs, then copy / paste the URL from the website into the **Base Graph URL**.

.. figure:: images/urlCopy.png
   :align: center
   
   URL copy of the graph from gratiaweb.

The App will parse the URL and determine if the graph can be retrieved.  If it is successful, it will add the graph to the profile.
