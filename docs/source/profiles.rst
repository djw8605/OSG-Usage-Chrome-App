Profiles
========

A profile is a collection of graphs grouped together.  A profile may define refining parameters which are applied to each of the graphs in the profile.  

It is often useful to have mutiple profiles that can show you different information.  One profile could show usage over the last 2 weeks for the Nebraska resources.  While another profile could show the usage over the last year of the HCC VO.
