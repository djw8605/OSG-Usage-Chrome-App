OSG Chrome App Tutorial
=======================

This tutorial will step you through running the Chrome App.  The first step is installation.


Installing
----------

To install the Chrome app, download it from the `Chrome App Store <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osg-usage-viewer/nmpkkpiafdfacaadmagknacaombpkeoe>`_.  The app is free, and should install quickly.  Once it is installed, you can launch in one of two ways:

1. When opening a new tab, click the **Apps** button at the top.  This will bring you to the Chrome application list, where you can find the newly installed OSG Usage Viewer application.

2. Using the `Chrome App Launcher <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/launcher>`_, which is installed with Chrome on Mac and Windows.


Initial Setup
-------------

When you first start the App, it will show a dialog to pick a profile.  This dialog shows a list of predefined profiles for you.  Choose the one most appropriate for you.  For example, if you are an OSG user, you would choose the *OSG User* profile.  Or, if you are a *Resource Owner*, choose that profile.  

After selecting a profile, enter a small amount of information required to restrict what the graphs will show.
