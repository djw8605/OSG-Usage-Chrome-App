=======================

This tutorial will step you through running the Chrome App.  The first step is installation.


Installing
----------

To install the Chrome app, download it from the `Chrome App Store <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osg-usage-viewer/nmpkkpiafdfacaadmagknacaombpkeoe>`_.  The app is free, and should install quickly.  Once it is installed, you can launch in one of two ways:

1. When opening a new tab, click the **Apps** button at the top.  This will bring you to the Chrome application list, where you can find the newly installed OSG Usage Viewer application.
